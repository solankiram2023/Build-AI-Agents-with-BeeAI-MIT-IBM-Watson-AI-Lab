# 🐝 Conference Prep AI Agent — BeeAI Framework Workshop

This repository contains my work from the **BeeAI Framework Workshop (MIT–IBM Watson AI Lab)**, where I built an **AI Agent** to assist with conference preparation by combining web search, Wikipedia knowledge, and internal documents.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Conference Prep AI Agent** helps marketing teams prepare for conferences by:
- Using **Web Search** for up-to-date news and trends.
- Leveraging **Wikipedia** for company history and background details.
- Querying **Internal Notes/Artifacts** for team-specific insights.

The agent was designed with **system prompts, memory management, and conditional requirements**, ensuring **reliable and rule-driven behavior**.
